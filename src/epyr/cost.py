# Executive Summary
display(Title("# Executive Summary"))
display(
    "This document provides a comprehensive cost analysis of EPYR's high-temperature "
    "thermal energy storage system compared to conventional heating technologies. "
    "The analysis demonstrates that our thermal storage solution offers significant "
    "cost advantages and carbon emission reductions across multiple industrial applications, "
    "particularly as renewable electricity prices continue to decline and carbon pricing mechanisms expand."
    "\n\n"
    "Key findings include:"
    "\n\n"
    "- Levelized cost of heat (LCOH) from our thermal storage system ranges from $0.04-0.08/kWh, "
    "competitive with or better than conventional fossil fuel heating in many applications"
    "\n\n"
    "- Payback periods of 2-7 years depending on the industrial application and local energy prices"
    "\n\n"
    "- Carbon emission reductions of 70-95% compared to fossil fuel heating systems"
    "\n\n"
    "- Increasing economic advantage over time as renewable electricity costs decline and carbon pricing increases"

# Introduction
display(Title("# Introduction"))
display(
    "## Industrial Heat Decarbonization Challenge"
    "\n\n"
    "Industrial process heat accounts for approximately 20% of global energy consumption and "
    "generates roughly 10% of global CO₂ emissions. Over 70% of industrial heat is currently "
    "produced using fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, coal, and oil. Decarbonizing this "
    "sector presents significant technical and economic challenges due to:"
    "\n\n"
    "- High temperature requirements (100-1000°C) for many industrial processes"
    "\n\n"
    "- Need for reliable, continuous heat supply"
    "\n\n"
    "- Price sensitivity in competitive industrial markets"
    "\n\n"
    "- Long investment cycles for industrial equipment (15-30 years)"
    "\n\n"
    "EPYR's thermal energy storage system addresses these challenges by enabling the "
    "use of renewable electricity for industrial heat applications, with storage capabilities "
    "that ensure reliable supply regardless of renewable generation variability."

    "\n\n"
    "- **Levelized Cost of Heat (LCOH)**: Total lifetime costs divided by total lifetime heat production"
    "\n\n"
    "- **Payback Period**: Time required to recover the initial investment through cost savings"
    "\n\n"
    "- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Percentage return on the initial investment over the system lifetime"
