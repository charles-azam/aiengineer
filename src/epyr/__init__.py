EPYR Thermal Energy Storage System Design Module.

This module contains components for designing, simulating, and analyzing
high-temperature thermal energy storage systems for industrial applications.

EPYR is developing advanced thermal energy storage solutions for industrial
decarbonization, focusing on high-temperature thermal batteries that store
renewable electricity as heat for later use in industrial processes.
