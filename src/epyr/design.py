display(
    "EPYR has developed an innovative high-temperature thermal energy storage (TES) system "
    "designed to address the growing need for efficient energy storage solutions in industrial "
    "applications. This design report details our modular TES system "
    "that can store excess energy as heat and deliver it on demand to industrial processes."
    "\n\n"
    "Our system achieves a round-trip efficiency of over 87%, with storage capacity "
    "of 1000 kWh and maximum operating temperature of 800°C. The design uses "
    "molten salt as the primary storage medium."
