# Introduction

This document presents the design of a 20 MW Small Modular Reactor (SMR) for electricity generation. 
The design focuses on safety, reliability, manufacturability, and economic viability. The reactor 
is designed to be factory-built and transported to the installation site, reducing construction time 
and costs.

The SMR uses proven pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology with enhanced passive safety features. 
It is designed for a 40-year operational lifetime with 4-year refueling intervals. The compact design 
makes it suitable for deployment in remote areas or as a replacement for aging fossil fuel plants.

## Design Objectives

1. Generate 20 MW of electrical power
2. Ensure inherent and passive safety
3. Minimize construction and operational costs
4. Enable factory fabrication and modular assembly
5. Provide reliable baseload power with high availability

# System Overview

The 20 MW SMR consists of three main systems:

1. **Reactor Core System**: Contains the nuclear fuel, moderator, control systems, and radiation shielding
2. **Primary Cooling Loop**: Transfers heat from the reactor core to the steam generators
3. **Secondary Steam Loop**: Converts thermal energy to electrical energy via turbine and generator

These systems are housed within a robust containment structure designed to prevent the release of 
radioactive materials under all credible accident scenarios.
