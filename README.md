# Engineer AI project

## Installation

This project is managed using the amazing uv package manager.

For a regular user, just run the following command:

```bash
uv sync
```

In dev mode use the following commands for installing:

```bash
cd .. # parent folder to aiengineer
git clone https://github.com/charloupioupiou/pyforge.git
git clone https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider.git
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents.git
export DEV_MODE=1
```
This way, I find it easier to dig inside those very powerful packages.
